        As you can see from the graph, over the course of almost 2 years there is a significant difference in how much households with children and households without children spend per category.
        Some of the most notable differences are Child Homes spending more on Groceries, Dairy, Produce, and Beverages, while ChildFree Homes Spending
        more on Food Service, Seafood, and Tabacoo Products. This is a trend of Child Homes spending more on necessities and Childfree Homes spending more on luxuries. One aditional note is that both homes spend 
        comparable amounts on alcohol.
